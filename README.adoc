= MP Metrics sample

This repo contains a sample of how the http://microprofile.io/[Eclipse Microprofile] spec apis could look like.
There is no spec yet and this sample is for illustration purposes.

== Building

----
$ mvn install
----

This will build the app and run on WildFly Swarm.

Tests in `src/it/java/de/bsd/mp_metrics/it/MpMetricsIT` are then run against that Swarm instance

== Running

----
$ java -jar target/mp-metrics-swarm.jar -Dmapping=src/main/resources/mapping.yml
----

== Using in Applications

`DemoBean` is showing how to submit metrical values in application code.
These are registered, in `MpMetricApplication#registerMetricsForDemoBean` which is the Jax-RS `Application` class
for the entire application.
